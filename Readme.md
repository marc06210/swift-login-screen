## step one - only ui

The tag is **only-login-ui**

In this step, we only construct the UI of the login screen. It display a logo on the center of the screen for 3 seconds.
After 3 seconds, this logo goes to the top of the screen and a login form shows up from the bottom of the screen.

## step two - hard coded login

The tag is **hard-coded-login**

In this step we will implement a login for a user whose username is **John** and password is **password**. The authentication will be asked again when the last successful one is older than **one** minute. this short delay is for demo purpose only.
